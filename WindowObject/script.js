console.log(window)
// window is a global object, which is created when a js code runs, created by browser
// this is a keyword which initially points to the window object(at global level)


var x=10;
console.log(x);

console.log(window.x);
console.log(this.x);

// JS is loosely  typed language, one variable initially may contain integer,then later string

// doing a=undefined is a bad practice (justify  to yourself)
